# Candy v3 multi gorups mint config
Candy Machine Initialization script for multi groups guards.

### Using this script
Make sure you had [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) installed globally

Then you need to install project dependecies
```bash
yarn install
```

Then you need to create candy machine config
```bash
yarn initialize
```

Then you need create nfts, I'm using already prepared nft's caches from sugar cli.
*Make sure to use sugar cli [alpha version](https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/sugar/releases)*
```bash
sugar deploy
```
